# DIY

* Lathe projects
* Wood working
* Electronics
* 3D printing
* Programming

I love making things, fixing some broken house hold items, or building my custom one. 
You can find some of my builds on my [github](https://github.com/sratatata) account or my [thingverse]( https://www.thingiverse.com/lezacy_bykiem/designs) account

## RC Models

* RC Drifting
* RC Trial

I love to build and customize my model, as it's a great source of DIY inspiration. 
It's very fascinating, how to drive such toys when you are outside of the car. You should try some day.

## Boardgames:

I like to play:
* strategy games 
* economics 
 
I can't list all of my games, my collection is really huge. I belive that board games social aspects made my team work skills shine. 

## Motorcycles

* Kawasaki Versys 1000
* Kymcko Downtown 300

It's my oldest passion, I love to observe a world from the motorcycle seat perspective.
I love traveling through western europe.
